# 101 Karate Games Video Downloader

This repository contains a Python script to automate the login, extraction, and download of videos from Hotmart's 101 Karate Games platform.

## Features
- Automates login to Hotmart
- Extracts video URL from lesson pages
- Supports MP4 and HLS (.m3u8) downloads
- Uses Selenium for browser automation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed
- Google Chrome installed
- WebDriver (managed automatically via `webdriver-manager`)
- `ffmpeg` installed (for HLS video downloads)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cloudartisan/101kg.git
   cd 101kg
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Set your login credentials**:
   - Edit `download.py` and replace `your_password_here` with your actual Hotmart password.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python download.py
   ```

3. **Downloaded videos** will be saved in the `videos/` directory.

## Notes
- The script logs in, navigates to the lesson page, extracts the video URL, and downloads it.
- If the video is in `.m3u8` format, `ffmpeg` is required to convert it to MP4.
- This script is for personal use only and should not be used to distribute copyrighted material.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that your Hotmart credentials are correct.
- If Chrome or WebDriver issues arise, update them:
  ```sh
  pip install --upgrade selenium webdriver-manager
  ```
- If login fails, Hotmart may have changed its authentication flow, requiring script adjustments.
